Hi Students,

For this lab, there are two parts, the Web Site automation testing and GitHub Issues defect tracking.
Please write a combined report, for both of the following, which is at least two pages (700 words) paper with your summary and reflections.
This is a group assignment, so work together with your Study Buddy.
Please turn in one combined report, which includes both students' reflections.
Both students should submit the same report.
The report should state how many hours it took each student (in the reflections sections).

## Web Site Automation
Selenium is a Web Site automation scripting test tool.
Please see this [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cobEbkTwbwY) about Selenium. If you have problems with that YouTube tutorial, try use this [Alternative Link](https://softwaretestingbooks.com/selenium-webdriver-script-in-netbeans-using-firefox) which will help you setup with NetBeans and FireFox.  Try and run Selenium, as you watch the video.  For example, you could write a script to do a Google Search.  Or you could login to Ltu.Se, with your student account.  If you fail, that is OK, but add your related reflections to the report.
The following is helpful, but optional: See [This URL](https://www.selenium.dev/)
Try to find another YouTube video which is helpful for learning Selenium and put that into your report.

## GitHub Issues
BugZilla is a defect tracking tool.
GitHub has a feature called Issues, which is also a defect tracking tool.
In this hands-on lab, you will learn and use GitHub Issues.
You will need to sign up for a GitHub account to enter GitHub Defect Issues, which is free.

As you read the documentation and see the following YouTube videos, you are required to try out creating issues on GitHub.
You can assign the issues to me, Todd Booth, which is the default.  I.E., you implicity assign it to me.
You can create fictitious Issues against this hands-on assignment repository.
If you have any suggestions to change this lab, you can create a real issue, instead of a fake issue.
Try adding images to the issues you create.

See the following videos and Web pages:

1. Video - [YouTube GitHub Issues Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKJ4RdhyB5Y).
2. Video - [YouTube video about GitHub and Issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E).
3. Web Pages - [This GitHub Mastering Issues Web Page](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
4. Web Pages [These GitHub Issues Documentation Web Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/managing-your-work-with-issues).

GitHub has their own one hour introduction course, which is optional and [Found Here](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github).

You will no longer need any of the Amazon AWS instances, so you can delete them all if you want.
Your original AWS $50 USD credits are good until January 3rd, 2021, so you can use them after this course is over.
Also, GitHub has a package deal where you can get another $100 USD in AWS Cloud Educate credits.
It also includes $100 in the Microsoft Azure Cloud and much more.  Here is the [GitHub Special URL](https://education.github.com/pack#offers).

In your report, please state if you are a program student, and if so, are you in Systems Science or Digital Service Innovation.

Good Luck, Teacher Todd
